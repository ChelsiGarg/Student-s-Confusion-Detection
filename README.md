Detecting students confusion in online class using EEG signals

In recent years, there is an increasing trend for online learning and it is more likely to continue in future also. Unlike classroom education, immediate feedback from 
the students is quite difficult in online classes. So, in order to get feedback from them or we can say in order to detect their confusion level, a <strong>single-channel EEG 
headset sensor</strong> can be used. This sensor is good enough for detecting students’ mental states and simple enough to use at home with very little training. Its signals are collected from students watching educational video clips. We trained and tested 
classifiers to detect when the scholar is confused while watching the course material. The classifier shows a comparable performance to human observers observing body 
language and expressions in predicting students’ confusion. We found accuracy in our model for using EEG to distinguish when a student is confused or not. This 
project promises deployable EEG devices having the power to capture tutor relevant information.

In this project, I worked on the dataset of students’ EEG brain activity while they learn from educational video clips. I trained and tested classifiers to detect when a student was confused. I used EEG signals to distinguish 
whether a student is confused. The classifier has comparable performance to human observers observing body language in predicting students’ confusion with <strong>accuracy of 97%</strong>. 
So, if the project is implemented on a bigger level like during online classes or the platforms which offer online courses, I am hopeful that this 
would help both teachers & students hence improving the quality of the content delivered.
